# MyTorchImplement
Using pytorch to implement semantic segmentation networks

this project can help your to build a semantic segmentation model quickly, your can use the main.py to train the model listed in the model/. also you can optimize the entire project.
I have trained  tested the ENet model on Camvid dataset, the result is shown blow
